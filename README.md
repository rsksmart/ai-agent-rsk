# Conversational AI Agent on Rootstock Testnet

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This is a prototype intended for hackathons, learning, and rapid prototyping. Use it at your own risk. It is not ready for production without further testing.**

This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight conversational AI agent that can interpret natural language and perform blockchain actions like checking token balances and sending tRBTC‚Äîall through a chat interface. It runs on the **Rootstock testnet** using [**Groq‚Äôs LLM API**](https://groq.com/), [**Reown AppKit**](https://reown.com/), and [**Wagmi**](https://wagmi.sh/), all wrapped in a [**Next.js app**](https://nextjs.org/) styled with [**Shadcn UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

> üîó Inspired by [BitMate](https://github.com/Zero-Labs-Workspace/BitMate) ‚Äì a hackathon project exploring the fusion of AI and DeFi on Rootstock.

## Features

- üîê Wallet connection via Reown AppKit (MetaMask, WalletConnect, embedded)
- üß† Natural language interface via Groq LLM API
- üí¨ Conversational agent with memory and action routing
- ‚ö° Send tRBTC and check token balances using plain English
- üñºÔ∏è UI powered by Next.js App Router and Shadcn components

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A browser wallet like MetaMask connected to the [Rootstock Testnet](https://explorer.testnet.rootstock.io/)

Optional but recommended:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.1+) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/ai-agent-rsk.git
   cd ai-agent-rsk
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install # or bun install or yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in the following values:

     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=
     NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_MAINNET=
     NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_TESTNET=
     NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=
     ```
   You can get the api keys this way:

   - ProjectId at [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com/)
   - RPCs at [Rootstock RPC API](https://dashboard.rpc.rootstock.io/dashboard)
   - Groq API Key at [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)

4. **Run the Dev Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev # or bun dev or yarn dev
   ```

## Project Structure

- `app/page.tsx` ‚Äî Main chat UI and wallet interface
- `src/lib/utils.ts` ‚Äî Wallet address validation and token lookup
- `src/lib/constants.ts` ‚Äî Block explorer URLs and other constants
- `components/` ‚Äî Reusable UI components and chat layout
- `app/api/ai` ‚Äî Endpoint to call Groq LLM API

## Troubleshooting

- **Groq API Key Not Working**: Make sure it‚Äôs correctly set in `.env.local` and not rate-limited.
- **Wallet Connection Fails**: Check MetaMask is on the Rootstock Testnet.
- **Token Not Found**: Make sure the token is an ERC-20 on Rootstock Testnet.
